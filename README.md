Scripts for **Starbase** by Oloneus

This is a repository of scripts for **Yolol**. All have been developed by my self and I've tried to debug them as much as I could.

I do not have any programming background and am just fiddling around with Yolol for StarBase by Frozenbyte.

So long
Olo

**This is a hobby of mine, and I enjoy creating these scripts for my ships**
If you intend to use them on your creations, I'd be glad to see some income in my CV. It took me serveral hundred hours to make these work as intendend. So for any Tips, send your **Thank You Credits** in game to **Oloneus**.
Thank you.
